      <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
      <p>
        CraftedPixels was born out of a late-night brainstorming session between
        two passionate designers who believed the digital world needed more
        human-centered creativity. With just a laptop and limitless imagination,
        they built their first website from a tiny dorm room.
      </p>

      <h2>Growing the Vision</h2>
      <p>
        What started small grew quickly. Through word of mouth and great client
        feedback, we expanded into a team offering full-stack design and
        development services. Over the years, we’ve collaborated with startups,
        non-profits, and Fortune 500s.
      </p>

      <h2>Where We Are Now</h2>
      <p>
        Today, CraftedPixels operates as a remote-first studio, with team
        members in over 5 countries, but still united by the same passion that
        started it all: creating with purpose and precision.
